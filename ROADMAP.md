# The Buzz.js Road map
I'm not going to describe Buzz.js again because the documentation for it not only exists inside the [README](./README.md) but also 
exists inside the package manager more extensively. The Buzz.js roadmap is split into 3 phases.

-	In the first phase, the base SDK is made. When I say base SDK here, I mean the fundamental Widgets that everything else is built
on top of. Even the other, more specified, widgets in the framework like the PageViews that are supposed to be the topmost Widgets in
the every Page in the WebApp â€” a System Navigable widget class. 

- 	In the second phase, the package manager is made for my host operating system, Linux, first using Flutter. It is a weird choice,
acceptably, because, why should a package manager be written with a GUI? It kinda seems either overkill or unnecessary, right? But
there are good reasons, for that much at least, I assure you. I plan to extend the package manager in the future to support things like
its own usable code editor dedicated to Buzz.js apps, a drag and drop style editor, and so on. Just because, why not? In the first
version of the package manager, the only affairs that would be supported would be publishing packages, managing your packages, building
your apps for the web, viewing your code in an editor that does nothing but highlight syntax, and update files. It would probably do
a lot more things but I would keep stuff simple in this documentation because this paragraph has run for too long. :joy:

-	In the third phase, the extension Widgets would be made. Extension widgets here means things like DashboardPageView, MobilePageView,
DesktopPageView, ResponsivePageView, and so on. Basically, things that are useful for Web Apps that I want to optimize as much as 
possible for the framework but not actually add to the base SDK. These things would however obviously be in the base SDK but I say not
adding here because, well, they come as an afterthought. Also, at the third phase, I would work on abstracting things involving hardware
like cameras, geolocation, microphones, and so on. Exhales, what a long way to go.
